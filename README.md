# Termux User Repository
Something similiar like AUR, But for Termux. Requires [shpkg](https://github.com/WMCB-Tech/shpkg) to be installed. 

This repository is still empty yet, However you're still welcome to made a build package script.

## Setting up Tur
```sh
echo https://github.com/Yonle/tur.git > ~/.config/shpkg_repo.list
shpkg update
```
